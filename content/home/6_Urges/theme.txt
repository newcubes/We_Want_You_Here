Description: Physical, sexual, and emotional abuse is very common in the lives of women. Addiction to drugs or alcohol to alleviate the pain frequently ensues. The resulting lifestyle, often compounded by poverty and prostitution, leads to intimate relationships that perpetuate further sexual and domestic violence. In other words, multiple forms of trauma usually precede a women’s abuse of substances and ultimate involvement in the criminal justice system.
