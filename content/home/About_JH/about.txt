Buckminster Fuller--Engineer-Architect-Futurist---- Header_1: My Release from Prison                                    ----        Description:            It's cold. I step down from the prison transport van before dawn at the bus station in Kansas City. I’m wearing recycled security guard pants, a T-shirt, and shower shoes. I have my prison ID, $5.00, and a massive case of overwhelm. It’s been four years. I’m out… but how am I going to make it in this world where I’ve already failed?              Two women come up, introduce themselves and welcome me. One is Georgia Walker, the woman who interviewed and accepted me to Journey House before my release. The other is Sister Gabe Smits. They give no instructions, requirements, or security questions--just smiles and an offer to stop for breakfast on our drive to my new residence for the next three months. I nod, but I can’t talk. I can’t stop crying. I’m too nervous to breathe.----
