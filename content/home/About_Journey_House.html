  <h3 style="text-align:center;">My Release from Prison</h3>
  <p class="Description">It's cold. I step down from the prison transport van before dawn at the bus station in Kansas City. I’m wearing recycled security guard pants, a T-shirt, and shower shoes. I have my prison ID, $5.00, and a massive case of overwhelm. It’s been four years. I’m out… but how am I going to make it in this world where I’ve already failed?
<br>
<br>
      Two women come up, introduce themselves and welcome me. One is Georgia Walker, the woman who interviewed and accepted me to Journey House before my release. The other is Sister Gabe Smits. They give no instructions, requirements, or security questions--just smiles and an offer to stop for breakfast on our drive to my new residence for the next three months. I nod, but I can’t talk. I can’t stop crying. I’m too nervous to breathe.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Journey House and Peace House</h3>
  <p class="Description">During the course of a year, nearly 4,000 women will be released from Missouri State prisons, and most will need home plans in order to do so. There are at least four major home plan options for women: release to the home of a family member or friend; release to a state-funded private residential facility; release to a state-operated community supervision center; or release to an independently funded private re-entry program.
     Journey and Peace House are such “new models” of independently- funded private re-entry program. These re-enty homes are the vision of Georgia Walker, Executive Director of Journey to New Life, and Sister Rose McLarney, who has experience with Restorative Justice. Journey to New Life is the umbrella organization for Journey and Peace Houses. The homes have been highly effective helping women transition back into the community.


The national average rate of women re-offending and returning to prison is a bleak 60%. The rate for Journey and Peace House graduates?... 6 percent.


      The guiding principles from Journey and Peace House home plans explain the low recidivism rate.</p>

<hr>
<ul class="a">
  <p> -“We find the good in these ladies and we don’t let up until they find it too.”</p>

    <p> -“We are guided by the principles of unconditional love, dignity, respect, and honesty.</p>

    <p> -“We are guided by the principles of unconditional love, dignity, respect, and honesty.</p>

    <p> -We are not prison-like. We live together as a family in a home atmosphere. There are no security cameras, severe rules, uniformed guards, or round-the-clock surveillance.  We know these do not foster learning to live in the real world where such structure does not exist. Our nation’s soaring recidivism rates attest to the fact that they also do not produce good results.</p>

    <p> -We serve women with nowhere else to turn, women who have experienced deep trauma and serious psychological issues. We assiduously avoid punishment as an automatic response to wrong-doing. Residents learn accountability for their actions.</p>

    <p> - We know that for women who are threatened by neglected health problems, traumatic pasts, poverty, homelessness, and the potential of relapse, the exit from prison is very often through a revolving door right back in--a personal and public safety risk.</p>

    <p> -Our approach is strength-based, as well as trauma and gender informed. Most of our women have been institutionalized by the rigidity of prison life. They fear making decisions and connecting with estranged children and family. They can have dual mental health diagnoses and substance use disorders.</p>

<p> -Several features make Journey and Peace House distinct from other programs: Our “curriculum” is constant interaction and experiential learning. The live-in personnel interact not just daily, but multiple times per day to give women feedback as they go about living and coping on the outside. These include such seemingly simple things as saying “thank you,” demonstrating good manners, following through, listening--not gossiping, being honest, sharing, spontaneously doing something nice, being a good housemate and neighbor, volunteering, and being on time. These basic impulses are not natural to all and are observed and absorbed a bit at a time. </p>
<p> -We coach housemates to help each other become part of mainstream society: how to ride the bus, use a cell phone and computer, keep appointments with parole officers and others, navigate going in a store and buying something, manage feelings that “everybody out here can tell I’m a felon,” pay a bill on time, take medication, say “no,” and stay focused on the goals they have set for themselves. These aspects of the “curriculum” are reinforced by paid Certified Peer Support Specialists who enhance the environment of recovery. </p>
<p> -We require all our residents to immediately receive: a “Well Woman” medical exam and prescribed medications; Behavioral/Mental Health assessments; counseling and psychiatric intervention; dental and eye assessment and care; and substance use disorder assessment and treatment.</p>
<p> -In every way possible, we support the women who are willing and able to reconnect with children and family. They may have their children stay with them on weekends. Many have burned bridges with family and friends and are striving to prove they can make a journey to new life with our support. Many can’t return home because their family members also have histories of drug addiction and/or incarceration.
</p>
<p> -Journey and Peace House women learn to “give back” in volunteer service. They connect with outside community members who visit and offer donations, as well as those who bring meals and stay to eat together. Not only are we telling them “We want you here,” but members of the community are saying “We want you back!” Residents are overwhelmed by the unmerited kindness, generosity and compassion shown to them. For many it is a first-time-ever experience, a potent antidote to feeling shameful and worthless. Emotional wellness is also evidenced by their willingness to speak out, sometimes for the first time, and share their stories for this project.</p>
<p> -Our women receive case management through Journey to New Life. During their approximately ninety-day, in-house stay, they work with their case manager on job-readiness and permanent housing.</p>
<p> -Aftercare: When an individual graduates from Journey or Peace House, her journey has just begun. At that point we provide the resources to pay the rental and utility deposits, three-months of rent and utilities in their new places, three months of cell phone service and transportation support. We continue to provide six months to one year of case management as needed.

Many graduates attain advanced education as Peer Support Specialists and themselves become live-in staff at Journey and Peace House. Georgia Walker and Rose McLarney describe the talent they look for in potential new staff: gentle disposition, helpful, solid experience of their own recovery, finely-tuned emotional muscle, strong intuition about what someone is going through, and an ability to find opportunities to build somebody’s strengths. We want staff women who are a ready resource to others. A promising force is the group of millennials and youth volunteers, who believe our approach is the right thing to do for human beings.</p>

<p> -Sher Bialcyzk, former Journey House manager, offers her “brutal honesty” and insight regarding what it’s like to re-enter the real world after prison. Her story: “The Metamorphosis of Sher Bialczyk” follows.</p>
