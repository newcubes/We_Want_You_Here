Quote: "For those you encounter, have compassion    even if they don’t want it   what seems bad manners is always a sign…    of things no ears have heard…   of things no eyes have seen.   You do not know what wars are going on   down where the spirit meets the bone…"

Description:  A spiritual presence appears in almost every Journey House story assuming multiple roles and powers: God the Father, the Devil, Savior, Judge, Holy Coach, Traitor, Apparition, and Vital Trusted Companion. The founders and staff at the Journey and Peace House are quite clear on the topic of Spirit. They embody Spirit as the pure infusion of respect, unconditional love, and dignity offered to every single woman who walks in the front door – women who have been traumatized and dehumanized by _themselves_ and others, women who are soon to sense that they are not worthless.
